<h3>THE COVER</h3>
<p>The cover design portrays the inter-relationships suggested by
the title of this booklet: On a trefoil symbolizing radiation are
superimposed a dividing cell, a plant, an animal, and a double helix
of a molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid, a material unique in and
fundamental to all living things.</p>

<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Here and elsewhere we shall not obtain the best insight
into things until we actually see them growing from the
beginning.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Aristotle</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nature of life has excited the interest of human
beings from the earliest times. Although it is still not
known what life is, the characteristics that set living things
apart from lifeless matter are well known. One feature
common to all living things, from one-celled creatures to
complex animals like man, is that they are all composed
of microscopic units known as cells.</p>
<p>The cell is the smallest portion of any organism that
exhibits the properties we associate with living material.
In spite of the immense variety of sizes, shapes, and
structures of living things, they all have this in common:
They are composed of cells, and living cells contain
similar components that operate in similar ways. One
might say that life is a single process and that all living
things operate on a single plan.</p>
<p>The past few years have been a time of rapid progress
in our understanding of the mechanisms that control the
function of living systems. This progress has been made
possible by the development of new experimental techniques
and by the perfection of instruments that detect what
happens in the tiny world of molecules. Prominent among
the methods that have contributed to the explosive growth
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
in our understanding of biology is the use of radioactive
isotopes as laboratory tools.</p>
<p>In this booklet we shall attempt to give an account, in
chemical terms, of the materials from which living matter
is made and of some of the chemical reactions that underlie
the manifestations and the maintenance of life. To accomplish
this, we have chosen to describe three types of
molecules that have become the basis of modern biology:
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and
proteins. We will show how radioactive isotopes can be
used to pry into the innermost secrets of these substances.
Before we can understand the function of these precious
molecules, however, it will be necessary to review the
structure of a cell and the physical nature of radioactive
isotopes.</p>
<h2 id="c2">CELL THEORY: DNA IS THE SECRET OF LIFE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We have seen that all organisms are composed of essentially
like parts, namely cells; that these cells are
formed and grow in accordance with essentially the
same laws; hence that these processes must everywhere
result from the operation of the same forces.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Theodor Schwann</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Unit of Life</h3>
<p>The cell theory, based on the concept that higher organisms
consist of smaller units called cells, was formulated
in 1838 by two German biologists, Mathias-Jacob Schleiden,
a botanist, and Theodor Schwann, an anatomist. The theory
had far-reaching effect upon the study of biological phenomena.
It suggested that living things had a common
basis of organization. Appreciation of its full significance,
however, had to await more precise knowledge of the
structure and activities of cells.</p>
<p>Some organisms,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> for instance, amoebae, consist of a
single cell each and are therefore called unicellular organisms.
Higher animals are multicellular, containing aggregations
of cells grouped into tissues and organs. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
man, for instance, consists of millions of many different
cells performing a variety of different functions. Cells of
higher animals differ vastly from one another in size,
shape, and function; they are specialized cells.</p>

</div>
<p>There is a remarkable similarity, moreover, in the
molecular composition and metabolism<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> of all living things.
This similarity has been taken to mean that life could have
originated only once in the past and had a specific chemical
composition on which its metabolic processes depended.
This structure and metabolism were handed down to subsequent
living things by reproduction, and all variations
thereafter resulted from occasional mutation, or changes
in the nature of the heredity-transmitting units. One of the
most extraordinary of all the attributes of life is its
ordered complexity, both in function and structure.</p>
<p>It is agreed among biologists that the functional manifestations
of life include movement, respiration, growth,
irritability (reaction to environmental changes), and reproduction
and that these phenomena are therefore possessed
by all cells. The first four of these can be grouped
under a single word: metabolism. We can therefore say
that living things have two common properties: metabolism
and reproduction. Therefore, when we say we are studying
life processes, we actually are studying the metabolism
and reproduction of cells. Since metabolism is the sum of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
the biochemical reactions taking place in a living organism,
it properly belongs to the field of investigation of biochemists.
Cell reproduction is the concern of both biochemists
and morphologists<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> since it can be studied by
either biochemical or morphological techniques.</p>
<h3>Cell Structure</h3>

&ldquo;little organs&rdquo;, of its internal structure. The organelles that are
labeled are important for this booklet.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The basic structure of a cell is shown in <a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a>. Each
cell consists of a dense inner structure called the nucleus,
which is surrounded by a less dense mass of cytoplasm.
The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a double
envelope, called the nuclear membrane, which is peppered
with perforations. The cytoplasm contains a network of
membranes, which form the boundaries of countless canals
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
and vesicles (or pouches), and is laden with small bodies
called ribosomes. This membranous network is called the
endoplasmic reticulum and is distinct from the mitochondria,
which are membranous organelles (little organs)
structurally independent of other components of the cytoplasm.
The outer coat of the cell is called the cell membrane,
or plasma membrane, and forms the cell boundary.</p>

25,000 times the actual size.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The nucleus, which in many cells is the largest and most
central body, is of special importance. It contains a number
of threadlike bodies, or chromosomes, that are the
carriers of the cell&rsquo;s heredity-controlling system. These
contain granules of a material called chromatin, which is
rich in a nucleic acid, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The
chromosomes usually are not readily seen in the nucleus
except when the cell, along with its nucleus, is dividing.
When the nucleus is not dividing, a spherical body, the
nucleolus, can be seen. (In some nuclei there may be more
than one.) When the nucleus is dividing, the nucleolus
disappears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Not all cells possess all these structures. For instance,
the red cells of the blood do not have a nucleus, and in
other cells the endoplasmic reticulum is at a minimum.
The diagram (<a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a>) is valid for a great majority of the
cells of higher organisms.</p>
<p>The cell structures shown in <a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a> are visible with
an electron microscope. They contain the chemical components
of the cell. The chief classes of these constituents
are the carbohydrates (sugars), the lipids (fats), the
proteins, and the nucleic acids. However, a cell also contains
water (about 70% of the cell weight is due to water)
and several other organic and inorganic compounds, such
as vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates serve mostly as foodstuff within the cell.
They can be stored in several related forms. Further,
they may serve a number of functions outside the cell,
especially as structural units. In this way structure and
function are correlated.</p>
<p>Lipids in the cell occur in a great variety of types:
alcohols, fats, steroids, phospholipids, and aldehydes. They
are found in all fractions of the cell. Their most important
functions seem to be to form membranes and to give these
membranes specific permeability. They are also important
as stores of chemical energy, mostly in the form of neutral
fats.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The proteins occur in many cell structures and are of
many kinds: Enzymes, the catalysts for the cell&rsquo;s metabolic
processes, are proteins, for instance. The nucleic acids
are DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid), which function together
to manufacture the cell&rsquo;s proteins. Since a large
share of the remaining pages will be devoted to a discussion
of proteins and nucleic acids, at this point we need
only emphasize that these two types of materials are
interrelated in their function and that both are essential.</p>
<h3>The Two Nucleic Acids</h3>
<p>It is not very fruitful to discuss whether proteins or
nucleic acids are more important. That question is something
like the one about the chicken and the egg. We cannot
think of one without thinking of the other. Although our
insight into the mutual dependence of these two materials
has greatly increased in recent years and although we
know the relation between them is a fundamental factor in
such events as reproduction, mutation, and differentiation
(or specialization) of cells, our understanding of their
interplay is far from complete. Real understanding of the
relation between them would give us insight into the essence
of growth&mdash;both normal and abnormal&mdash;or, indeed,
one could almost say, into the complexity of life itself.</p>

<p>Practically all the DNA of most cells is concentrated in
the nucleus. RNA, on the other hand, is distributed throughout
the cell. Some RNA is present in the nucleus, but most
of it is associated with minute particles in the cytoplasm
known as microsomes, some of which are especially rich
in RNA and are accordingly named ribosomes. These are
much smaller particles than the mitochondria.</p>

</div>
<h3>Mitosis</h3>
<p>One of the most remarkable characteristics of cells is
their ability to grow and divide. New cells come from
preexisting cells. When a cell reaches a certain stage in
its life, it divides into two parts. These parts, after another
period of growth, can in turn divide. In this way plants and
animals grow to their normal size and injured tissues are
repaired. Cell division occurs when some of the contents
of the cell have been doubled by replication, or copying (to
be discussed later). The division of a cell results in two
roughly equal new parts, the daughter cells. The process
of cell division is known as mitosis and is diagrammed in
<a href="#fig_6">Figure 6</a>.</p>
<p>Mitosis is a continuous process; the following stages of
the process are designated only for convenience. During
<i>interphase</i> the cell is busy metabolizing, synthesizing new
cellular materials, and preparing for self-duplication by
synthesizing new chromosomes. In <i>prophase</i> the chromosomes,
each now composed of two identical strands called
chromatids, shorten by coiling, and the nucleolus and
nuclear membrane disappear. During <i>metaphase</i> the chromosomes
line up in one plane near the cell equator. At
<i>anaphase</i> the sister chromatids of each chromosome separate,
and each part moves toward the ends, or poles, of
the cell. During <i>telophase</i> the chromosomes uncoil and
return to invisibility; a new nucleus, nucleolus, and nuclear
membrane are reconstituted at each end, and division of
the cell body occurs between the new nuclei, forming the
two new cells. Each daughter cell thereby receives a full
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
set of chromosomes, and, since the genes are in the
chromosomes, each daughter cell has the same genetic
complement.</p>

<p>All life processes use up energy and therefore require
fuel. The mitochondria have a central role in the reactions
by which the energy of sugars is supplied for cellular
activity. The importance of this vital activity is obvious.
In this booklet, however, we are concerned with the
processes, involving nucleic acids and proteins, that can
be described as making up &ldquo;the gene-action system&rdquo;. The
gene-action system is the series of biochemical events
that regulate and direct <i>all</i> life processes by &ldquo;transcription&rdquo;
of the genetic &ldquo;information&rdquo; contained in molecules of
DNA.</p>

<h3>Atomic Structure</h3>
<p>Practically everyone nowadays is to some extent familiar
with the atomic structure of matter. Atomic energy, nuclear
reactors, and radioisotopes are terms in everyday
usage. However, to appreciate how radioisotopes can be
applied to the study of life processes, we must have at
least a working knowledge of their properties, their preparation,
and their limitations. It is therefore appropriate
to examine them in detail so that the succeeding chapters
will be more easily understood.</p>
<p>According to present-day theory, an atom consists of a
nucleus<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> that is made up of protons and neutrons<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> and is
surrounded by electrons. In each atom there is an equal
number of protons (positively charged) in the nucleus and
electrons (negatively charged) moving concentrically around
the nucleus; since neutrons have no electrical charge and
since protons and electrons cancel each other&rsquo;s charges,
the whole atom is electrically neutral, or uncharged. Each
atom is identified by an atomic number and an atomic
weight. The atomic number of an element (for example,
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) is determined by the number of
protons, or positive charges, carried by the nucleus (or by
the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus, which is
the same). The atomic weight is the weight of an atom as
compared with that of the atom of carbon, which is taken
as a standard. The weight, or mass, of an atom is due
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
chiefly to its protons and neutrons because the mass of its
electrons is negligible.</p>
<h3>Isotopes</h3>
<p>Atoms of the same element, that is, atoms with the same
number of protons and electrons, may vary slightly in
mass because of having different numbers of neutrons.
Since the chemical behavior of an element depends upon
its electrons&rsquo; electrical charges, extra neutrons (which do
not have an electrical charge) may affect the mass of an
atom without disturbing its chemical properties. Atoms
having the same atomic number but different atomic
weights are called isotopes. For example, as shown in
<a href="#fig_8">Figure 8</a>, the isotope &sup1;H, or ordinary hydrogen, consists of
a nucleus containing a proton (charge: +1; mass: 1) around
which revolves an electron (charge: -1; mass: negligible);
&sup2;H, known as deuterium, contains an additional nuclear
particle, a neutron (charge: 0; mass: 1); &sup3;H, or tritium,
contains two neutrons. Since the chemical behavior of an
element depends upon the number of its electrons, these
three atoms, although differing in weight, behave identically
in chemical reactions. For convenience, the atomic weight
is written as a superscript to the left of the element&rsquo;s
symbol. For instance &sup1;&#8308;C is the isotope of carbon with an
atomic weight of 14 (ordinary carbon is the isotope with an
atomic weight of 12, and it is written &sup1;&sup2;C).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_8">
<img src="images/f8.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="183" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 8</b> <i>Isotopes of hydrogen.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Practically all elements have more than one isotope.
There are two general classes of isotopes, stable and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
radioactive. Stable isotopes have no distinguishing characteristic
other than their mass; radioactive isotopes not
only differ from their brothers in mass but also are
characterized by unstable nuclei. When the nucleus of an
atom is unstable, because of an unbalanced number of
protons and neutrons, a redistribution occurs sooner or
later, and the atom decomposes spontaneously and emits
one of several kinds of radiations. Because of their common
mode of action and effects on living organisms, these
different kinds of radiations are known collectively as
ionizing radiations.</p>
<p>All radioactive elements emit one or more of three
types of penetrating (ionizing) rays. <i>Alpha rays</i> or particles
are double-charged helium nuclei, &#8308;He (atomic
number: 2; mass: 4). They are emitted by many heavy
radioactive elements, such as radium, uranium, and
plutonium. <i>Beta rays</i> or particles can be either positive
or negative. Negative beta particles are high-speed electrons
and are emitted by many radioactive elements.
Positive beta particles are positively charged electrons
(positrons), have only a transitory existence, and are less
common. <i>Gamma rays</i> are electromagnetic radiations, a
term that also describes radiowaves, infrared rays, visible
light, ultraviolet light, and X rays. Gamma rays are
usually emitted after the emission of alpha or beta particles.
In our studies of life processes, we are interested
only in the radioactive isotopes that emit gamma rays or
beta particles.</p>
<h3>Radioactive Isotopes</h3>
<p>Radioactive isotopes occur as minor constituents in
many natural materials, from which they can be concentrated
by fractionation procedures. In a very limited number
of cases, more significant amounts of a radioactive
isotope, for example, radium or radioactive lead, can be
found in nature. Most radioactive isotopes in use today,
however, are prepared artificially by nuclear reactions.
When a high-energy particle, such as a proton, a deuteron,
an alpha particle, or a neutron, collides with an atom, a
reaction takes place, leading to the formation of a new,
unstable compound&mdash;a man-made radioactive isotope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The great usefulness of radioactive isotopes, as we
shall see later, is that they can be detected and identified
by proper instruments. Biochemists have long recognized
the desirability of &ldquo;tagging&rdquo; or &ldquo;labeling&rdquo; a molecule to
permit tracing or keeping track of the &ldquo;label&rdquo; and consequently
of the molecule as it moves through a reaction
or process. Since the radiations emitted by radioactive
isotopes can be detected and measured, we can readily
follow a molecule tagged with a radioactive atom.</p>

</div>
<p>The earliest biochemical studies employing radioactive
isotopes go back to 1924, when George de Hevesy used
natural radioactive lead to investigate a biological process.
It was only after World War II, however, when artificially
made radioactive isotopes were readily available, that the
technique of using isotopic tracers became popular.</p>
<p>In our investigations of life processes, we are especially
interested in three radioactive isotopes: &sup3;H, the hydrogen
atom of mass 3; &sup1;&#8308;C, the atom of carbon with atomic weight
14; and &sup3;&sup2;P, the atom of phosphorus with atomic weight 32.
These radioactive isotopes are important because the
corresponding stable isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, and
phosphorus are present in practically all cellular components
that are important in maintaining life. With the
three radioactive isotopes, therefore, we can tag or label
the molecules that participate in life processes.</p>

</div>
<p>Hydrogen-3 is a weak beta emitter; that is, it emits
beta particles with a very low energy (0.018 Mev<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>) and
therefore with a very short range. Carbon-14 is also a
weak beta emitter (0.154 Mev), although the beta particles
emitted by &sup1;&#8308;C have a higher energy and therefore a longer
range than those emitted by &sup3;H. The beta particles emitted
by phosphorus-32 are quite energetic (1.69 Mev) and have
a longer range.</p>
<h3>Radioactive Isotopes&rsquo; Value in Biological Studies</h3>
<p>To biologists, then, the essential feature in the use of
radioactive isotopes is the possibility of preparing
&ldquo;labeled&rdquo; samples of any organic molecule involved in
biological processes. With labeled samples it is possible
to distinguish the behavior and keep track of the course of
molecules involved in a particular biological function.</p>
<p>In this capacity the isotope may be likened to a dynamic
and revolutionary type of &ldquo;atomic microscope&rdquo;, which can
actually be incorporated into a living process or a specific
cell. Just as a real microscope permits examination of the
structural details of cells, isotopes permit examination of
the chemical <i>activities</i> of molecules, atoms, and ions as
they react within cells. (Neither optical nor electron
microscopes are powerful enough for us to see anything
as small as a molecule clearly.)</p>

<h2 id="c4">DNA SYNTHESIS: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CELLS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Here, surely, is the prime substance of life itself.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Isaac Asimov</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The many characteristic features of each living species,
its complex architecture, its particular behavior patterns,
the ingenious modifications of structure and function that
enable it to compete and survive&mdash;all these must pass,
figuratively speaking, through the eye of an ultramicroscopic
needle before they are brought together as a new,
individual organism. The thread that passes through the
eye of this needle is a strand of the filamentous molecule,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Let us now outline the research
that led to these conclusions.</p>
<h3>DNA in Somatic and Germinal Cells</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental laws of modern biology&mdash;which
states that the DNA content of somatic cells is constant for
any given species&mdash;was first set forth in a research report
of 1948. This finding means that in any given species,
such as a mouse or a man, all cells except the germinal
cells contain the same amount of DNA. Germinal cells,
that is, the sperm cells of the male semen and the female
egg, contain exactly half the amount of DNA of the somatic
cells. This must be the case, since DNA is the hereditary
material, and each individual&rsquo;s heredity is shaped half by
his father and half by his mother. One ten-trillionth of an
ounce of DNA from a father and one ten-trillionth of an
ounce of DNA from the mother together contain all the
specifications to produce a new human being.</p>
<p>A large amount of DNA must be manufactured by an
individual organism as it develops from a fertilized egg
(one single cell) to an adult containing several million
cells. For instance, a mouse cell contains about 7 picograms
of DNA (one picogram is one millionth of a microgram,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
or one millionth of one millionth of a gram). A
whole mouse contains in its body approximately 25 milligrams
(25 thousandths of a gram) of DNA, and all this DNA
was synthesized by the cells as the mouse grew to adulthood.
Since the amount of DNA per cell remains constant
and since each cell divides into two cells, it is apparent
that each new cell receives the amount of DNA characteristic
of that species.</p>
<p>Once we realize that a cell that is making new DNA (as
most cells do) must divide to keep the amount of DNA per
cell constant, it follows that a cell that is making DNA is
one that is soon destined to divide. If we can now mark
newly made DNA with a radioactive isotope, we can
actually mark and thus identify cells that are preparing to
divide. The task can be divided into two parts: (1) to label
the newly made DNA and (2) to detect the newly made,
labeled DNA.</p>
<h3>Replication of DNA</h3>
<p><a href="#fig_11">Figure 11</a> is a diagram showing the essential structure
of the large DNA molecule. According to the Watson-Crick
model,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> the molecule consists of two strands of
smaller molecules twisted around each other to form a
double helix. Each strand consists of a sequence of the
smaller molecules linked linearly to each other. These
smaller molecules are called nucleotides, and each consists
of three still smaller molecules, a sugar (deoxyribose),
phosphoric acid, and a nitrogen base. Each nucleotide and
its nearest neighbor are linked together (between the sugar
of one and the phosphoric acid of the neighbor). This
leaves the nitrogen base free to attach itself, through
hydrogen bonding, to another nitrogen base in the opposite
strand of the helix.</p>
<p>In the DNA of higher organisms, there are only four
types of nitrogen bases: adenine, guanine, thymine, and
cytosine. Adenine in either strand of the helix pairs only
with thymine in the opposite strand, and vice versa, and
guanine pairs only with cytosine, and vice versa, so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
each strand is complementary in structure to the other
strand (see <a href="#fig_12">Figure 12</a>). The full structure resembles a
long twisted ladder, with the sugar and phosphate molecules
of the nucleotides forming the uprights and the linked
nitrogen bases forming the rungs. Each upright strand is
essentially a mirror image of the other, although the two
ends of any one rung are dissimilar.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_11">
<img src="images/f11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="379" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 11</b> <i>Diagrammatic structure of the DNA molecule as proposed
by the Watson-Crick model.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When DNA is replicated, or copied, as the organism
grows, the two nucleotide strands separate from each
other by disjoining the rungs at the point where the bases
meet, and each strand then makes a new and similarly
complementary strand. The result is two double-stranded
DNA molecules, each of which is identical to the parent
molecule and contains the same genetic material. When
the cell divides, each of the two daughter cells gets one of
the new double strands; each new cell thus always has the
same amount of DNA and the same genetic material as the
parent cell.</p>
<p>(All that has been said so far about DNA replication
depends upon an assumption that the DNA molecule is in
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
some way untwisted to allow separation of two helical
strands, but there is no compelling reason to believe that
such an untwisting does indeed take place, nor do we know,
if the untwisting does take place, how it is accomplished.
Much that has been said in the last few paragraphs is
therefore purely speculative. It is, however, based on
sound observation and is a more logical explanation than
others that have been advanced.)</p>

<h3>Labeling DNA with a Radioactive Isotope</h3>
<p>Of the four bases in DNA, three are also found in the
other nucleic acid, RNA; but the fourth, thymine, is found
only in DNA. Therefore, if thymine could be labeled and
introduced into a number of cells, including a cell in which
DNA is being formed, we would specifically label the newly
synthesized DNA, since neither the old DNA nor the RNA
would make use of the thymine. We could in this way mark
cells preparing to divide. (Actually, thymine itself is not
taken up in mammalian cells, but its nucleoside is. A
nucleoside is the base plus the sugar, or, in other words,
the nucleotide minus the phosphoric acid.) The nucleoside
of thymine is called thymidine, and we say that thymidine
is a specific component of DNA and can be used, both in
laboratory studies and in living organisms, for labeling
DNA.</p>
<p>Thymidine labeled with radioactive compounds is available
as &sup1;&#8308;C-thymidine (thymidine with a stable carbon atom
replaced by a radioactive carbon atom) and as &sup3;H-thymidine
(thymidine in which a stable hydrogen atom has been replaced
by tritium). Thus, when cells actively making DNA
are exposed to radioactive thymidine, they incorporate it,
and the DNA becomes radioactive.</p>
<p>We have thus found a way to complete the first part of
the task, the labeling of new DNA. We still must find out
how to distinguish labeled DNA among the many components
of the cell. We might do it with a system based on measuring
the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the
DNA of cells exposed to radioactive thymidine, as an approximation
of the frequency of cell division in the group
of cells. However, a better method for studying cells
synthesizing DNA, and thus preparing to divide, is the use
of high-resolution autoradiography.</p>
<h3>Detecting DNA with Autoradiography</h3>
<p>Autoradiography is based on the same principle as
photography. Just as photons of light impinging on a
photographic emulsion produce an image, so do beta particles
(or alpha particles) emitted by decomposing radioactive
atoms. A photographic emulsion is a suspension of
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
crystals of a silver halide (usually silver bromide) embedded
in gelatin. When crystals of silver bromide are
struck by beta particles, the silver atoms are ionized and
form a latent image, so called because it is invisible to
our eyes. After the emulsion is developed and fixed, each
little aggregate of reduced silver atoms becomes a visible
black speck on the emulsion. The distribution and combination
of the specks make up the photographic image (see
<a href="#fig_14">Figure 14</a>). In ordinary photography such an image is a
negative, which has to be converted into the positive
photograph by printing. In autoradiography we are satisfied
to look at the negative image since the clusters of developed
silver atoms, appearing under a light microscope
as black dots, supply all the information we need.</p>

<p>The distinction of having made the first autoradiograph
belongs to the French physicist, Antoine Henri Becquerel;
and to another Frenchman, A. Lacassagne, goes the credit
for having introduced this technique into biological studies.
Lacassagne used autoradiography to study distribution of
radioactive polonium in animal organs. After World War
II, when radioactive isotopes were first available in appreciable
quantities, autoradiography was further perfected
through the efforts of such scientists as C. P. Leblond in
Canada, S. R. Pelc in England, and P. R. Fitzgerald in the
United States.</p>
<p>Today autoradiography is sufficiently precise to locate
radioactively labeled substances in individual cells and
even in chromosomes and other structures within the cell.
Two conditions must be met to achieve this high resolution:
(1) The radiation from the radioactive element in the cells
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
must be of very short range. (2) The cells must remain
in close contact with the photographic emulsion throughout
the various experimental manipulations. When these conditions
are met, the black dots will appear in the emulsion
directly above the cell or cell part from which the radiation
came (see <a href="#fig_14">Figure 14</a>).</p>
<p>Shortness of range is satisfied by use of tritium, since
its beta particles travel only about 1 micron (one thousandth
of a millimeter) and the diameters of mammalian
cells range from 15 to 40 or more microns. A mammalian-cell
nucleus is at least 7 to 8 microns in diameter.</p>

<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 15</b> <i>Cells being prepared for autoradiography. (a) Cells being
coated with a photographic emulsion. (b) Coated cells being exposed
to produce a latent image.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The condition of close contact between cells and emulsion
is achieved by the technique of dip-coating autoradiography.
In this process the glass slide on which the cells are
carried is dipped into a melted photographic emulsion (see
<a href="#fig_15">Figure 15</a>a), a thin film of which clings to the slide. After
it has been dried, the slide is placed in a lighttight box
and kept in a refrigerator for the desired period of exposure,
usually several days or weeks. During this period
disintegrating radioactive atoms within the cells continue
to emit beta particles, which, in turn, produce a latent
image in the overlying emulsion. After the exposure is
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
complete, the slide is developed and fixed like a photographic
plate, and a stain is applied which penetrates the
emulsion so that the outlines of the cells and their internal
structures can be seen. The fixing process removes all
silver bromide that has not been ionized so that the
emulsion is reduced to a thin, transparent film of gelatin
covering the stained cells and containing only the clusters
of silver grains that were struck by the beta particles.</p>

</div>
<p>When the finished autoradiograph is examined under the
microscope, it will look like the radioautographs of tumor
cells in <a href="#fig_16">Figure 16</a>. In the upper micrograph the tumor
cells are the larger ones and the smaller ones are blood
cells. The dense structures in the center of the tumor
cells are nuclei. The cells were exposed to tritium-labeled
thymidine, and those synthesizing DNA at the time
of exposure took up the thymidine and became radioactive.
They can be identified by the black dots overlying the
nuclei; the dots are the aggregates of silver grains struck
by the beta particles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Notice that only the nuclei contain radioactivity; the
reason for this is that radioactive thymidine is incorporated
only into DNA localized in the nuclei of cells.
This picture identifies not only the cells that were making
DNA at the time the label was administered but also the
cells that were destined to divide in the immediate future,
since cells synthesize DNA in preparation for cell division.</p>
<p>If we want to compare two populations of cells to find
out which is proliferating (dividing) more actively, counting
the fraction of cells labeled will give the number of cells
synthesizing DNA in preparation for cell division. Of
course, a rough approximation of the proliferating activity
can be obtained by simply counting the number of cells
actually dividing. But with tritiated thymidine we can
obtain not only much more accurate measurements but
also considerable information that cannot be obtained by
simply counting the number of cells in mitosis. We shall
discuss the cell cycle later on, but for the moment we
should emphasize that much of our knowledge of the cell
cycle stems from the use of high-resolution autoradiography.</p>
<p>It is clear that autoradiography enables us to find out
<i>which</i> cells are dividing in a cell population and <i>how many</i>
of them do so. For instance, in a given tissue or organ,
not all cells are capable of dividing into two daughter cells.
In the epidermis, which is the thin outer layer of the skin,
only cells in the deepest portion can divide. The other
cells, although originating from cells in the deep layer,
have lost the capacity to divide, and eventually die without
further division. If we take a bit of skin, expose it to
tritiated thymidine, and determine the amount of radioactivity
incorporated into the skin cells&rsquo; DNA, we obtain
a fair measurement of the amount of DNA being synthesized.
However, this purely biochemical investigation cannot
possibly give any information on which specific cells
are synthesizing DNA. For this, autoradiography provides
the information we need.</p>

<h2 id="c5">RNA SYNTHESIS: HOW TO TRANSLATE ONE LANGUAGE INTO ANOTHER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Mathematicians are like Frenchmen: whatever you say
to them they translate into their own language, and
forthwith it is something entirely different.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Wolfgang von Goethe</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have mentioned previously that there are two main
types of nucleic acids: DNA, the genetic material itself,
and RNA, the molecule that translates the genetic message
from DNA into terms the cell can use as &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;
for making protein. Cells differ from each other
on the basis of kinds of proteins they contain, and, since
differences among cells determine differences among organisms,
it follows that differences in the composition of
DNA serve to explain the variety in living organisms
populating the world. However, if differences between two
organisms can be explained by differences in the chemical
composition of their respective DNA&rsquo;s, how can we explain
differences between cells of the same organism? How can
we explain that cells of the human pancreas secrete insulin,
whereas other cells in man produce no insulin? Or how
can we explain that certain cells make bone and others
make fat? If indeed all cells in the same organism contain
the same amount and kind of DNA (since all DNA in an
organism derives from the duplication of the DNA of the
fertilized egg cell and its descendants), it would seem, at
first glance, that DNA is not the molecule responsible for
differences among the cells. The clarification of this apparent
contradiction is found in the remarkable properties
of the other nucleic acid, the translator molecule, RNA.</p>
<h3>Three Kinds of RNA</h3>
<p>In the first place, there are at least three different kinds
of RNA. The largest quantity is a special kind called
ribosomal RNA, or r-RNA. It is found in close conjunction
with proteins and makes up the structural frame upon
which the protein-synthesizing machinery is built. The
r-RNA and the proteins to which it is firmly bound form
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the ribosomes, the RNA-rich microsomes that are attached
to the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins are synthesized on
ribosomes. We shall see later what determines the differences
among proteins and how these differences are
dictated directly by RNA and indirectly by DNA.</p>
<p>Besides r-RNA, there is a kind of RNA called soluble
RNA, or transfer RNA, or s-RNA. It combines with r-RNA
to complete the sequence of events that synthesizes the
proteins. A bond between r-RNA and s-RNA is established
by a third RNA molecule called messenger RNA, or
template RNA, or m-RNA. This m-RNA molecule is truly
the messenger that carries the genetic message from DNA
to the protein-synthesizing apparatus.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Shimkin, a Temple University scientist,
in his analogy has compared the DNA &rarr; RNA &rarr; protein
sequence to the activities of a newspaper staff. DNA is
the editor; m-RNA molecules are copyboys who carry the
editorials to the typesetters, the r-RNA and s-RNA, who
then take the &ldquo;letters&rdquo; of nucleic acid and set them into
slots in accordance with the editor&rsquo;s directions. There
are also workers who melt down outworn letters and still
other workers who make new letters for further use; these
are the enzymes, special kinds of proteins. If we wish to
continue the analogy, we may say that each kind of cell in
the organism has a different subeditor, who writes that
cell&rsquo;s own editorial. Actually we might say that all cells
have the same board of editors in common, but only one
editor functions in any given type of cell. In biological
terms this means that only a portion of all the cellular
DNA is active in each cell.</p>
<p>The active DNA is the DNA that makes m-RNA that will
carry instructions to the protein-synthesizing machinery
of that type of cell. Cells of the same organism therefore
differ from each other on the basis of the segment of DNA
that is active in making m-RNA. Let us now see how we
can use radioactive isotopes to investigate the synthesis
of RNA.</p>
<h3>Labeling RNA with a Radioactive Isotope</h3>
<p>RNA synthesis is investigated with radioactive tracers
in the same way as DNA synthesis. If we can mark, with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
radioactive atom, a small molecule that is incorporated
into newly formed RNA, we can then trace the course of
the labeled RNA molecule with a radiation-detection device.
DNA had one advantage in this regard&mdash;the fact that one
compound, thymidine, was a precursor of DNA, a specific
material that could be incorporated only into DNA. We do
not know similar specific precursors of RNA. But we
know several precursors that are predominantly incorporated
into RNA; the most common of these are the nucleosides
adenine, cytidine, and uridine, and the smaller
molecule, orotic acid. All these precursors can be labeled
with either &sup3;H or &sup1;&#8308;C, and their incorporation into RNA can
be measured.</p>
<h3>Detecting RNA with Autoradiography</h3>
<p>As in DNA synthesis, we can use autoradiography to
follow the incorporation of precursors into RNA. By
proper treatment of the tissues, we can make sure that all
the radioactivity visible by autoradiography is due to
labeled RNA, even though some of the precursor also
enters DNA molecules. Even so, the kind of information
obtained from autoradiographs of tissues exposed to RNA
precursors is different from that obtained with DNA precursors.
The advantage of high-resolution autoradiography
in DNA studies is the possibility of identifying particular
cells that are synthesizing nucleic acid. This advantage
is apparently lost in the case of RNA. The reason is that,
at any given time, only a few cells are making DNA,
whereas practically all cells are synthesizing RNA constantly.
The only exceptions are cells in the midpoint of
mitosis. At the beginning (prophase) and at the end of cell
division (telophase), RNA is synthesized. If we want a
quantitative measurement of RNA synthesis, other methods,
to be examined presently, are considerably more precise.
But autoradiography can still give us valuable information.</p>
<h3>Other Methods of Detecting RNA</h3>
<p>If we look at cells soon after they have been exposed to
an RNA precursor, we find that the radioactivity detectable
by autoradiography is only in the nuclei of the cells. No
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
radioactivity can be detected in the cytoplasm, although we
know that the cytoplasm of living cells contains large
amounts of r-RNA and s-RNA. One or two hours later,
however, radioactive RNA appears in the cytoplasm as
well as in the nucleus. What autoradiography is telling us
is that RNA is made in the nucleus and then is slowly
transferred to the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Autoradiography cannot tell us whether the RNA that has
been newly synthesized in the nuclei of cells is m-RNA,
s-RNA, or r-RNA. The methods necessary to make this
distinction are based on the chemical fractionation of the
tissue, isolation of RNA, determination of its amount by
quantitative analysis, and determination of the amount of
radioactivity by physical methods. Let us examine these
steps separately.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_17">
<img src="images/f17.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="442" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 17</b> <i>Injecting a mouse with a radioactive solution.</i></p>
</div>
<p><b>Chemical Fractionation of Tissue</b> After an animal has been
injected with a radioactive precursor of RNA, some of it
will be incorporated into DNA as well as into RNA (remember
that the precursors of RNA lack specificity), and
part of the precursor will be broken down into smaller
molecules. The injected animal can be sacrificed, and an
organ or another tissue, for instance, the liver, can be
removed. Then the liver is homogenized, that is, ground
to a pulp with a modern version of the mortar and pestle.
The homogenate (pulp) is treated with cold (weak) acid.
Proteins and nucleic acids are insoluble in cold acids and
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
therefore precipitate to the bottom of the test tube. All
molecules that are soluble in a cold acid are left in the
supernatant (the remaining liquid); among these are small
molecules, like those of the RNA precursor. The precipitate
(the solid material that settles to the bottom), now
containing proteins and nucleic acids, is then treated with
a strong alkali, for instance, sodium hydroxide. Alkali will
digest RNA into smaller molecules but does not affect
DNA. If we now add acid to the solution, DNA, being insoluble
in acid, will precipitate again; RNA, having been
broken down into small molecules, will remain in the
supernatant. DNA can then be extracted from the precipitate
by boiling in strong acid. Proteins from the tissue
remain in the final residue.</p>
<p>We have now fractionated the tissue into four portions:
the acid-soluble fraction (containing small molecules),
RNA, DNA, and proteins. (The cell&rsquo;s lipids and sugars
come out during alcohol rinses between the weak acid and
the alkali steps.) Chemical analysis allows us to measure
precisely the amount of RNA or DNA in its respective
fraction and therefore in the tissue or organ. The amount
of radioactivity in the RNA fraction can then be determined
by a technique known as liquid scintillation counting.</p>
<p><b>Liquid Scintillation Counting</b> Liquid scintillation counting
is the preferred method for the measurement of low-energy
beta-emitting radioisotopes commonly used in cell-fractionation
studies (see <a href="#fig_18">Figure 18</a>). It is convenient,
sensitive, and rapid for routine measurement of radiation
in hydrocarbons, other organic compounds, and aqueous
solutions containing such isotopes as &sup3;H, &sup1;&#8308;C, and &sup3;&sup2;P.</p>
<p>Liquid scintillation solutions share with other scintillating
materials the property of converting into visible
light the energy deposited in them by ionizing radiation.
In theory, if a sample of a beta emitter is dissolved in a
liquid scintillator solution, every beta particle emitted will
be absorbed completely because the range of penetration
of beta particles in liquids is quite short (ranging from
0.008 millimicron for &sup3;H to 7.9 millimicrons for &sup3;&sup2;P in a
medium of unit density). The kinetic energy of the beta
particles is largely used up in the ionization and excitation
of the most abundant molecular species present, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
solvent in which the scintillating material was dissolved.
A fraction of the energy thus expended by each beta particle
is transferred from excited solvent molecules to scintillator
molecules; thus the electrons in the atoms of the
scintillator molecules are raised to an excited (higher
energy) state. When these electrons return to the ground,
or unexcited, state, a fraction of them emit a photon of
light. Thus each beta particle produces a burst of photons.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_18">
<img src="images/f18.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="499" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 18</b> <i>Technician placing a tray of samples
in a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactivity of each
sample is recorded as the trays revolve.</i></p>
</div>
<p>If a vessel containing the liquid scintillator and the
radioactive sample is placed near a suitably sensitive
instrument known as a photomultiplier tube, each burst of
scintillator photons activates this device and causes it to
release a burst of photoelectrons. Each burst of photoelectrons
is multiplied successively in a series of electronic
steps; as a result, there is a suitably large electrical-output
pulse to be recorded.</p>
<p>One of the principal advantages of the liquid scintillation
method is the ease of sample preparation. We need only
transfer a known volume of a liquid sample or weigh a
given mass of a solid sample into a sample bottle, add a
known amount of the liquid scintillator solution, and stir
until there is a homogeneous solution. Samples thus prepared
are placed in a refrigerated counting apparatus.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
After a short waiting period to allow time for the samples
to cool and for a natural, short-lived phosphorescence (due
to exposure to room light) to subside, the samples are
ready to be measured.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_19">
<img src="images/f19.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 19</b> <i>Placing radioactive samples in a refrigerated unit for liquid scintillation counting.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One disadvantage of liquid scintillation counting is that
different compounds show different degrees of quenching
(loss of emitted photons), and the effect must be checked
for each class of compounds in each concentration range.
This checking is usually done with an internal standard
technique, the sample being counted before and after a
standard, or known, emitter is added.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is that the best scintillating solvents
are not the best chemical solvents for most biological
materials. The solubility problem is also aggravated by
the low temperatures at which liquid scintillation counters
are usually operated for more effective instrument performance.</p>
<p>With the method we have described, we can obtain a
fairly accurate idea of the rate of RNA synthesis in a given
tissue. There are other things we would like to know about
RNA. The first of these is the kind of RNA being synthesized.
During alkaline digestion all kinds of RNA are
broken down into their component nucleotides; we must
therefore use other methods if we wish to know the kind of
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
RNA in which the radioactivity of the precursor has been
incorporated.</p>
<p><b>Isolation of RNA</b> Native RNA, that is, RNA not broken
down into its smaller constituents, can be obtained in a
variety of ways, but the most popular one makes use of
phenol extraction, which removes DNA and proteins and
leaves RNA in solution. If this phenol-purified RNA is
dissolved in a concentrated sugar solution and spun in a
centrifuge at a very high velocity, it will separate into
three major components. These components separate because
they have different molecular weights, and the larger
the molecule, the faster it forms a sediment in the centrifugal
field. Two of these components are s-RNA, the
lightest of all, and r-RNA, which is divided into two subfractions.
We can also identify a third component, m-RNA,
with the centrifuge system but only with some difficulty
and only after labeling it with a radioactive precursor,
because the amount of m-RNA in a cell is very small.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_20">
<img src="images/f20.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="512" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 20</b> <i>Diagram of ascending paper chromatography.</i></p>
</div>
<p><b>Quantitative Analysis</b> Another important feature of RNA
(or DNA, for that matter) is its base composition, that is,
the percentage of each of the nucleotides that make it up.
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
The four bases that, with ribose and phosphoric acid,
comprise the RNA molecule are guanine, adenine, cytosine,
and uracil. It will be noted that three of the four&mdash;guanine,
adenine, and cytosine&mdash;are the same as those in DNA, but
thymidine in DNA has been replaced by another base,
uracil. To determine the percentage of each base in a
given RNA molecule, we must digest RNA with alkali to
produce mononucleotides, which are smaller molecules,
each consisting of a base, ribose, and phosphoric acid.
We can now separate the four nucleotides by using paper
chromatography (see <a href="#fig_20">Figure 20</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_21">
<img src="images/f21.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="452" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 21</b> <i>A paper chromatography showing separation of amino
acids in two directions. Radioactivity in samples then produced
this record by radioautography.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In this technique a mixture of compounds is deposited on
the edge of a special type of paper. This edge is then immersed
in a solvent that slowly permeates the paper (at a
constant speed) by capillary action. As the solvent moves
from the immersed edge toward the other edge, which is
hanging freely, it carries the mixture of nucleotides with
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
it. Each of the compounds in the mixture travels at a different
speed, however; thus, as the solvent front moves
along the paper, the dissolved compounds are separated
from each other and appear as distinct spots on the paper.
To locate the nucleotides on the paper and to determine the
percentage composition, we can use a chromatogram
scanner, a device that scans the paper chromatograms,
measures the radiation from them, and thus locates the
labeled substances (see <a href="#fig_22">Figure 22</a>).</p>

<p>Another technique used to separate the nucleotides of
RNA is column chromatography. In this method mixtures
of nucleotides are separated as they pass down a column of
chemicals (see <a href="#fig_23">Figure 23</a>).</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>We have now learned how to use radioisotopes to investigate
the synthesis of RNA, the molecule that translates
the DNA message into the language of proteins. Let
us now see what we can learn about the synthesis and
function of proteins.</p>
<h2 id="c6">PROTEIN SYNTHESIS: THE MOLECULES THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>If a man will begin with certainties he shall end in
doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts he
shall end in certainties.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Francis Bacon</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proteins occupy a central position in the structure and
functioning of living matter and are intimately connected
with all the metabolic reactions that maintain life. Some
proteins serve as structural elements of the body, for
instance, hair, wool, and the scleroproteins of bone and
collagen, the latter an important constituent of connective
tissue. Other proteins are enzymes, which are extremely
important since they regulate all metabolic reactions.
Most of the proteins in the tissues of actively functioning
organs, such as the liver and the kidney, are enzymes.
Other proteins participate in muscular contraction, and
still others are hormones or oxygen carriers. Special
proteins called histones are associated with gene function,
and the antibodies that an organism produces to defend
itself from bacteria are also proteins.</p>
<p>The differences in proteins, especially in enzymes,
account for differences among cells. It is now appropriate
to ask what makes one protein different from another. We
know that the structure of a protein depends upon several
factors, such as the molecular weight. But the main differences
among proteins depend upon the sequence, or
order, of the amino acids that are linked together in the
protein molecules.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h3>Amino Acids and Protein Structure</h3>
<p>Amino acids are the fundamental structural units of
proteins. There are 20 amino acids found frequently in
mammalian proteins, and these molecules may be linked
to one another to form a chain called a polypeptide chain.
The structure of a protein then depends on: (1) the quantity
of each amino acid present; (2) the sequence of amino acids
in the polypeptide chain; (3) the length of the polypeptide
chain, that is, the molecular weight; and (4) the folding and
the side (nonlinear) arrangement of the polypeptide chain
molecules, that is, the secondary and tertiary structures.</p>
<p>How can we investigate protein synthesis by using radioactive
isotopes? Since proteins are made up of amino
acids, the logical conclusion, after what we have learned
about DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis, is that the best
way would be to mark an amino acid and follow its incorporation
into a molecule of protein. We could label a
mixture of several amino acids, but, for the sake of clarity,
we will describe the incorporation of a single labeled
amino acid.</p>
<h3>Labeling an Amino Acid with a Radioactive Isotope</h3>
<p>Suppose we have the amino acid leucine labeled with
&sup1;&#8308;C and we inject a solution containing it into an experimental
animal. Since leucine is incorporated into proteins,
if we isolate the proteins and determine both the amount of
proteins and the amount of radioactivity, we can measure
fairly accurately the rate of protein synthesis. Autoradiography,
by the way, is of little help in studying most protein
synthesis because all cells are always synthesizing proteins
and so are all labeled after a single exposure to a radioactive
amino acid. With RNA precursors autoradiography
at least told us where RNA was being made, but with amino
acids we do not even get this information because proteins
are synthesized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances radiochemical methods are
better for studying protein synthesis. Proteins are isolated
from the residue left after a nucleic-acid extraction process
similar to that described previously, and the amount of
protein is determined by a simple colorimetric analysis
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
based on comparison of the color of the solution with a
standard color. The amount of radioactivity (remember
that we are now using a precursor labeled with &sup1;&#8308;C) can be
determined with a gas-flow counter, which is probably
more widely used at present than any other instrument for
counting beta emitters, chiefly because of its reliability
and low cost.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CELL CYCLE AND GENE ACTION: LIFE IS THE SECRET OF DNA</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when
you find a trout in the milk.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Henry David Thoreau</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a biologist interested in the mechanism of cell
proliferation, the most important event in the life of a cell
was, until very recently, cell division. As we mentioned,
when a cell divides into two daughter cells, it undergoes a
process called mitosis; mitosis itself is subdivided into
four stages called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and
telophase. Mitosis in most cells takes less than one hour.
Between one mitosis and the next, there can be an interval,
from a few hours to several days in length, during which a
cell is said to be in interphase. The entire period between
the midpoints of two successive mitoses is called the cell
cycle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3>Interphase</h3>
<p>Until a few years ago, we knew very little about interphase.
In fact, in one classic book on histology,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> while a
description of mitosis required almost 12 pages, interphase
was dismissed in less than six lines! The reason for this
lack of interest was, of course, the fact that no adequate
methods were available for studying metabolic activities of
cells in interphase. The methods of high-resolution autoradiography
and radiochemical analysis of synchronized
cell populations have become available only in the past
few years.</p>
<p>We now know that metabolic activities during interphase
are of primary importance in understanding the mechanism
of cell division. It is, in fact, the orderly sequence of
metabolic events occurring in interphase that leads from
one mitosis to the next.</p>
<h3>The Cell Cycle</h3>
<p><a href="#fig_25">Figure 25</a> is a diagram of the cell cycle. Try to imagine
the cell cycle as a race track and individual cells as cars
that race around it. You are sitting at the finish wire,
which is mitosis (we chose mitosis because it is easy to
recognize when the cell is observed with the aid of a
microscope). At a certain time during the race, all the
cars in a portion of the track, say a 200-yard sector of the
backstretch, are sprayed with a blue dye as they race by.
These cars are now marked, just as cells synthesizing
DNA are marked if briefly exposed to tritiated thymidine,
the common radioactive precursor of DNA. As soon as
these cars have been sprayed, you observe all the cars as
they pass the finish line in front of you. At first, you will
see cars that were nearest the wire and were not sprayed;
then the dye-marked cars will pass; and finally more unmarked
cars, those that had passed the finish line but had
not reached the spray area when the marking was done,
will come by. If you replace the words spray, cars, and
wire with the words radioactivity, cells, and mitosis, you
have described the cell cycle and the flow of cells in the
cycle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Now, if all cars were going at the same speed, you could
calculate with great accuracy the time taken for any one
car to go around the track, or from the finish line to the
backstretch, or through the spray sector, and so on. However,
since cars move at different speeds, you can only
obtain an average time for all sprayed cars. Similarly,
since individual cells behave differently, you can only
obtain averages of the times these cells spend in the
various portions of the cell cycle.</p>

<br />THE CELL CYCLE</b></p>
</div>
<p>These cell-cycle portions are four in number, according
to nomenclature originated by A. Howard and S. R. Pelc,
two English investigators who first described the cycle:
(1) mitosis; (2) G&#8321;, which is the period between mitosis
and DNA synthesis; (3) S phase, which is the period during
which DNA is replicated; and (4) G&#8322;, which is the period
between DNA synthesis and the next mitosis. Only cells
in the S phase (DNA synthesis) are marked when exposed
to a radioactive precursor of DNA.</p>
<h3>DNA Synthesis and the Cell Cycle</h3>
<p>Because it has several important implications in biology
and medicine, it is important to remember that DNA
synthesis occurs only during the short, well-defined S
period of the cell cycle. Other synthetic processes go on
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
throughout the cycle. We mentioned, for instance, that all
cells can be labeled by a brief exposure to a radioactive
amino acid, a precursor of proteins; this means that
protein synthesis occurs throughout the entire cell cycle,
including mitosis. When we use a radioactive RNA precursor,
all cells except those in anaphase and metaphase
are labeled; this means that RNA synthesis occurs throughout
the entire cycle except during anaphase and metaphase.
But a radioactive tag on a DNA precursor reveals that
only during the S phase is there DNA synthesis.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>It is also important to remember that a cell that has
synthesized DNA is a cell that, with a few exceptions, will
divide in the very near future. Thus, for an understanding
of the mechanisms that control cellular proliferation, it is
important to investigate the factors that control DNA
synthesis. Our recent knowledge of the cell cycle has
therefore led to a shift in the focus of investigation from
mitosis to DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>Another point to remember is that not all cells keep
going through the cell cycle indefinitely. As shown in
<a href="#fig_25">Figure 25</a>, when a cell divides, the daughter cells have
two alternatives, either to go through another cycle or to
leave it altogether. Cells that leave the cycle are called
differentiated cells and will eventually die without any
further division. Many cells in an adult organism also
have lost the capacity to make DNA and therefore the
capacity to divide. These cells often have other specialized
functions in the body; examples are nerve cells and muscle
cells.</p>
<p>The synthesis of other macromolecules (giant molecules,
like DNA) connected with the gene-action system is another
field of active investigation. We have described how we
can investigate the synthesis of proteins and RNA with
radioactive isotopes, and we have given some information
on the gene-action system, which is also shown in <a href="#fig_26">Figure 26</a>.</p>
<p>The genetic material of a cell is DNA. The DNA molecule
is in the form of a double-stranded helix that is
supported by a protein backbone. Genes are often described
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
as simply segments of DNA. They differ from
each other only in the order in which the four nucleotide
bases that make up DNA are arranged. (Look at <a href="#fig_13">Figure 13</a>
again.) Since a single gene is usually made up of several
hundred bases, it is easy to imagine the infinite variety of
genes that could exist by simply changing the order of the
four bases several hundred times.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_26">
<img src="images/f26.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="260" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 26
<br />THE GENE-ACTION SYSTEM</b></p>
</div>
<p>Not all genes in the cells of a living organism are active.
In fact, most of them are inactive, or, as geneticists say,
repressed. What represses genes to make them inactive
is not known, but many investigators believe the activity,
or lack of it, is regulated by proteins called histones. If a
gene is repressed, nothing happens; it remains inactive,
presumably until something removes the repressing factor.
But an active gene sets in motion a train of events that results
in activation of one of the processes of life: The
gene&rsquo;s DNA directs the manufacture of RNA, which in turn
brings about the synthesis of a specific protein to carry
out a specific metabolic process. In other words, all the
activities of the cell are dictated by active genes (the DNA
molecules) through the mediation of RNA and are executed
by proteins.</p>
<p>Here is what happens as nearly as scientists can reconstruct
it:</p>
<h3>Translation of the Genetic Message</h3>
<p>The DNA of a particular active gene manufactures a
molecule of m-RNA by the same kind of replication that it
uses for making more DNA. In m-RNA the sequence of
bases is the same as in the parent DNA segment; for this
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
reason, m-RNA is also called DNA-like RNA. As shown in
<a href="#fig_12">Figure 12</a>, a cytosine molecule in m-RNA corresponds to a
cytosine molecule in DNA, a guanine to a guanine, and so
on, except that the m-RNA has uracil in all the places
where thymine occurs in DNA. The order of the nucleotides
in the m-RNA is the same as that in the DNA, so the
m-RNA carries the genetic code of the gene that made it.
This process, all of which occurs in the cell nucleus, is
one of copying, or transcription, rather than translation,
since the same &ldquo;codewords&rdquo; (the nucleic-acid bases) are
reproduced.</p>
<p>The new m-RNA molecule then travels from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm and attaches itself to an unoccupied
ribosome (see <a href="#fig_27">Figure 27</a>). Here it fits to a molecule of
r-RNA and blends its shape geometrically, or spatially,
with the shape of the r-RNA in lock-and-key, or jigsaw-puzzle,
fashion. The combined new RNA molecule is now
capable of manufacturing a specific protein.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_27">
<img src="images/f27.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="509" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 27</b> <i>Protein synthesis in a ribosome (microsome), and its

<p class="caption smaller">

</div>
<p>At this point an s-RNA molecule arrives, bringing with it
one amino-acid molecule, which then combines with other
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
amino acids in the specific order dictated by the RNA to
form a specific protein. After the amino acids have been
formed into the protein molecule, they detach themselves
from the s-RNA molecule. The s-RNA molecule has two
recognition sites by which it matches up to its neighbors:
One recognizes, or &ldquo;fits&rdquo;, the amino acid, and the other
recognizes a corresponding triplet of bases on m-RNA.
There is thus a particular s-RNA molecule for each amino
acid and a particular triplet of bases on the m-RNA
molecule for each triplet of bases that is specific to the
s-RNA molecule.</p>
<p>In this process the machinery has translated the nucleic-acid
code into the protein code; that is, it has translated a
sequence of the bases into a sequence of amino acids. This
process is therefore called translation of the genetic
message. Once the protein has been synthesized, it will
become active in performing some of the cell&rsquo;s metabolic
activities.</p>
<p>The gene-action system actually is somewhat more
elaborate than this. There are feedback mechanisms, genes
that control the activity of other genes, either directly or
through the production of specific proteins, and so on.
However, the scheme just outlined gives a fair, if simplified,
idea of how the genetic message is carried to the
entire cell and how it is translated into actual life processes.</p>
<h2 id="c8">ISOTOPES IN RESEARCH: PROBING THE CANCER PROBLEM</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>... a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Winston Churchill</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The various procedures in which radioactive isotopes
play a major role have been applied to many studies and
investigations in the fields of biology and medicine. In
fact, most of the concepts of modern biology that we have
been discussing in this booklet owe their discovery to the
judicious use of radioisotopes. To illustrate how radioisotopes
can be used to solve a practical problem, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
have chosen a typical example, the investigation, at a
molecular level, of the effectiveness of an anti-cancer
drug.</p>
<p>Several drugs that exert a beneficial effect, at least
temporarily, on the course of certain cancers have been
used by doctors for several years. Most of them were
discovered empirically, that is, by accident, during routine
trials against cancers. Doctors know they work but do not
always know how. They would also like to know the
mechanism of the drugs&rsquo; action at the molecular level so
that the knowledge might open the way to the discovery of
other drugs more effective against cancer and less toxic
against normal cells. The following experiment shows
how the molecular effect of an anti-cancer drug is studied.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_28">
<img src="images/f28.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="423" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 28</b> <i>Technician preparing tissues for comparative studies.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Cells growing in tissue cultures are often used to test
anti-cancer drugs (see <a href="#fig_28">Figure 28</a>). These cells, derived
from human cell lines, are grown in glass or plastic
bottles as a suspension in a nutrient medium. To begin, a
culture is divided into halves. To one half is added the
anti-cancer drug Actinomycin D. The other half will continue
to grow without addition of other substances and will
serve as a control, or comparison. After a suitable time
has elapsed for the drug to act on the cultured cells,
similar portions of the drug-treated cells and the control
cells will be tested in several ways. One portion of each
kind of cells is incubated with &sup3;H-thymidine to determine
the effect of the drug on DNA synthesis. Two other portions
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
are incubated with &sup3;H-cytidine to study the effect on RNA
synthesis. Another pair will be tested with &sup1;&#8308;C-leucine to
investigate protein synthesis. The effect of the drug, of
course, is determined by comparing the untreated control
with the drug-treated culture.</p>
<p>The biochemical, autoradiographic, and counting techniques
that we described previously are all used to determine
the uptake of the radioisotopes into the cell&rsquo;s components.
Chromatography is used to ascertain if the drug
has changed the concentration of precursors (thymidine,
cytidine, or leucine) in the nutrient medium, since a change
in these could produce misleading results. Finally, if the
drug is found to have an effect on RNA, we can investigate
the type of RNA that is affected by centrifuging phenol-purified
RNA.</p>
<p>The results will disclose the primary site (DNA, RNA,
or proteins) of the drug action on cell metabolism. More
elaborate experiments can pinpoint more intimately the
mechanism of action. By studying the life processes of
cells, we can advance toward a common denominator in
anti-cancer drugs that will lead to an effective anti-cancer
treatment.</p>
<h2 id="c9">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Thus, the task is, not so much to see what no one has
seen yet; but to think what nobody has thought yet, about
what everybody sees.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Arthur Schopenhauer</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of radioactive isotopes in the study of life
processes is of importance in understanding them. With
the use of autoradiographic and radiochemical techniques,
it is possible to obtain valuable information regarding the
life of cells and the intimate mechanisms by which life
processes determine the fate of the entire organism.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the cell cycle and of the gene-action
system has been useful in determining how organisms
grow and how cancer cells behave. It has been determined
that certain normal adult cells divide more frequently
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
than some cancer cells and that the growth of cancers
depends not so much on the speed of cellular proliferation
as on the number of cells actually dividing.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_29">
<img src="images/f29.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="217" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 29</b> <i>Radioautograph showing DNA synthesis during chromosome
replication. Chromosomes from cells in the root tip of the
Tradescantia plant were labeled with &sup3;H-thymidine. In A and B,
the midportion of DNA synthesis, the radioisotope is distributed
throughout the chromosome arms; in C, near the end of DNA
synthesis, it is confined mainly to the end of the arms.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Knowledge of the cell cycle has also brought new insight
to the control of cell division, as in studies related to the
therapy of cancer. The most important problem now is,
not the control of cell division, but the control of the
synthesis of DNA.</p>
<p>Our information on the gene-action system provides
broad new opportunity for the investigation of many life
processes. Hormone action, processes by which the body
develops immunity to disease, and even cell division itself
are apparently regulated through the gene-action system.
This, in turn, offers possibilities for investigations meant
to control these processes.</p>
<p>It is difficult to chart the future course of modern
molecular biology, but it is not difficult to predict that the
next few years will bring to biology the same kind of sweeping
advances that revolutionized physics a few decades ago.
The DNA molecule has been called the atom of life. When
we have harnessed it, the harnessing of the uranium atom
will seem, in comparison, a result of scientific adolescence.
When man has mastered the genetic code, he&rsquo;ll hold a vast
power in his hands&mdash;power over the nature of coming
generations.</p>
